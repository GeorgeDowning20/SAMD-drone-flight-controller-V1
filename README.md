# SAMD-drone-flight-controller-V1

Having created, a blinking LED on a microcontroller, I now had the skills reqired to try something more advanced:

How about a multirotor flight controller??

Hardware: 
SAMD21 breakout board,
BNO055 IMU,
SIK radio,
Ibus Serial rc link  (flysky)
genreic 4 in one esc, and motors, 3 inch props,
fully 3d printed frame

it flew awfully, however it flew!! pretty awsome for a first project.
